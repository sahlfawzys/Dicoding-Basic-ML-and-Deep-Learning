This repository contains Dicoding final project rock-paper-scissor classification using the CNN model. The result of this project is that the computer can recognize rock, scissors, and paper images, and also players can play rock-paper-scissors against the computer.
The process in this image detection project is as follows:
1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Split validation data by 40%
3. Image augmentation
4. construct the CNN model
5. CNN model training
6. Predict data

The resulting CNN model has an accuracy rate of 90% and a val_accuracy rate of 90%
